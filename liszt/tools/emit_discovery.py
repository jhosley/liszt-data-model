Emit a discovery specification from a scenario record that has not been scored.

    python3 tools/emit_discovery.py 021
    python3 tools/emit_discovery.py 021 --pipeline mirrored
    python3 tools/emit_discovery.py 021 --org platform-eng
    python3 tools/emit_discovery.py 021 --check          # readiness only, write nothing

Two files land in specs/DISC-<id>-<slug>/ :

    discovery.yaml    the machine readable specification
    discovery.md      the same spec in the spec-driven agent convention, generated

THERE IS NO PREDICTION FILE, AND THAT IS THE POINT. tools/emit_testspec.py asks an
agent to check a claim that already exists, and seals that claim in prediction.yaml
before the run so hindsight cannot rewrite it. Discovery asks an agent to establish
a claim that does not exist yet: go run the scenario, observe what came out, say
which layer it came from, and propose first DeTT&CT numbers for a person to accept
or reject. With nothing predicted there is nothing to seal, and an empty prediction
file would manufacture the appearance of a claim nobody made.

WHAT THE EMITTER REFUSES TO DO. It will not emit from a published record, because a
published record is scored and belongs to the scoring path; from a retired one,
because there is nothing left to learn; from a failure-mode scenario, which has no
adversary to emulate; or from a doomsday record, whose emulation is a separate
decision. It also refuses a record with no framework baseline and a step with no
evidence row, since a proposal needs a row to land in.

WHAT IT SHARES WITH THE SCORING EMITTER. The action sets, the prohibited list, the
stop conditions and the environment builder are imported from emit_testspec.py, not
copied, so the two specs cannot drift on what an agent may do. What is NOT shared is
the observation block: that one encodes claims, and discovery has none.

THE RETURN PATH. The agent's answer is a discovery run record, runs/DISC-<id>-<date>-<NN>.yaml,
validated by schema/discovery-run.schema.json. tools/discovery_to_session.py turns
the proposals a person accepts into a session file, and tools/apply_session.py
writes them into the record with score_provenance: agent-proposed. Nothing on this
path writes itself.
