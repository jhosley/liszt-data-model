Two classes of finding:
  ERROR    the record is structurally wrong, or violates a rule that must hold
  WARN     the record is legal but falls short of the quality bar in docs/02

Publication gate: a record with status 'published' must have ZERO errors and
ZERO warnings. A draft may carry warnings, that is what draft means.
