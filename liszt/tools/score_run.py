"""
Score a run against its sealed prediction, and say what the result should change.

    python3 tools/score_run.py runs/RUN-021-2026-08-05-01.yaml --write

WHAT IS BEING SCORED. Not the attack, and not the estate. The evidence map. Every row of
a scenario is a falsifiable claim about what our systems would emit and whether we would
notice, and this compares that claim to what a run actually found. The output is a
calibration number for the PROCESS, which is the only way to find out whether the library
is describing the estate or describing our optimism.

THE THREE REFUSALS. This tool refuses to score:

  1. against a prediction whose digest no longer matches the file on disk, because a
     prediction edited after the run is not a prediction;
  2. a claim outside the venue the environment can test, because a scratch lab that
     scores detection claims produces a confident wrong number;
  3. a coverage tag whose truth depends on the detection pipeline when no pipeline was
     mirrored. A scratch lab can fully falsify a Blind row and cannot fully confirm a
     Have one, and pretending otherwise is the failure this whole exercise exists to
     catch.

That third refusal is the useful one to say out loud: a cheap lab is a Blind hunting
instrument. That is worth having, and it is not the same as a detection test.
