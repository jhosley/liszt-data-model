"""
Coverage, exposure and maturity rollup. Implements docs/04-measurement.md.

    python tools/coverage.py                        # published records, reference assessment
    python tools/coverage.py --org platform-eng     # apply a coverage/<org>/ overlay
    python tools/coverage.py --include-drafts       # see the whole library, drafts included
    python tools/coverage.py --json out/snap.json   # immutable snapshot for trend reporting
    python tools/coverage.py --json out/snap.json --prior out/last.json   # fill the period ledgers
    python tools/coverage.py --gaming               # run the anti-gaming checks only
    python tools/coverage.py --shape SHAPE-AI       # one infrastructure shape per run (the default)

Three metric families, deliberately kept apart because they answer different
questions for different audiences:

  COVERAGE  proportion of attack steps adequately instrumented.   Engineering.
  EXPOSURE  which NOW-priority scenarios still have Blind steps.  Risk.
  MATURITY  is the PROCESS working: reviewed, scored, owned,      Program.
            evidenced, funded. Moves independently of the other two.

The cardinal rule: an unscored row does not count as zero, it does not count at
all. Scoring nothing and scoring badly must not produce the same number.

The same rule, one step on: a row whose scores are agent-proposed (score_provenance
from a discovery run, see docs/13-discovery-mode.md) is listed, and counted nowhere.
A proposal a person has not accepted is not a measurement, and a rollup that averaged
it in would read as measured when nothing had been. Proposed rows appear in their
own column so their existence is visible and their numbers are not.

The snapshot this writes is the shape schema/snapshot.schema.json defines, which is the
shape docs/04-measurement.md section 5 specifies. It is validated before it is written.
