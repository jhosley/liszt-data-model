Emit an agent test specification, and the sealed prediction that goes with it, from a
scenario record.

    python3 tools/emit_testspec.py 021 --sealed-by "A. Analyst"
    python3 tools/emit_testspec.py 021 --pipeline mirrored --sealed-by "A. Analyst"
    python3 tools/emit_testspec.py 021 --org platform-eng --sealed-by "A. Analyst"
    python3 tools/emit_testspec.py 021 --check          # readiness only, write nothing

Three files land in specs/ST-<id>-<slug>/ :

    spec.yaml         the machine readable specification, schema validated
    spec.md           the same spec in the spec-driven agent convention, generated
    prediction.yaml   what we claim the run will find, to be committed BEFORE it runs

WHY THE PREDICTION IS A SEPARATE FILE. The scenario's coverage tags are already
predictions; this exercise only means something if they are frozen before the answer is
known. Committing prediction.yaml is a discrete, timestamped act, so git is the notary.
The run record binds to it by sha256, which is what makes a prediction quietly revised
after the fact detectable rather than merely discouraged.

WHAT THE EMITTER REFUSES TO DO. It will not emit from a record that cannot be scored
against: unpublished, unscored rows, a source-less Have or Collectable, or a baseline
the record does not actually speak. Those are not warnings. A spec emitted from a record
with an unscored row produces a run that answers a question nobody asked.

The procedure is deliberately engine agnostic. It states intent, technique and expected
artifact; an adapter binds it to an emulation runner at execution time. Specs outlive
runners, and an abstract action set is also the only form that can be reviewed for safety
before anyone chooses a tool.
